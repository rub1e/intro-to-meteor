# Introduction to Meteor  

## What?  
A simple one-day workshop to introduce the wonder of Meteor to the sixth Founders & Coders cohort.  

This workshop is not intented to *teach* the intricacies of Meteor, but rather to introduce core concepts and principles, and demonstrate how easy it is to get a project up and running using this platform.  

To bring it to life, we'll follow a simulatneously expanded and contracted version of the official Meteor tutorial, from [here](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app).  

## Why?

> Writing software is too hard and it takes too long.  

## How?  

* (Assuming you already have node installed) Install meteor from https://www.meteor.com/install  
* Follow the instructions in each file
